Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a branch of computer science that involves the development of code, maintainance of it, testing and further optimising. It is important in the technology industry because it is the basic building blocks of most applications, websites or software that we use. Any software that we use on a daily basis has been developed from the principles and knowledge of software engineering.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Mastering Complexity
Mastering Process
Mastering Machine


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning - identifying the purpose of the software and the scope
Requirement Analysis - identifying the end user specification
Design - building the framework 
Coding -  converting software into code
Testing - examing the code if it runs as intended without any bugs or issues


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
A waterfall methodologies is a development pathway where development is linear, with the one step requires to be finished before another is taken on. This linearity may lack flexibility and no changes may be made after a step is finished because any step following will have to be changed also. Testing can only be done at the end and customer feedback comes later down the road after delivery.

Agile methodologies is a development pathway where multiple cycles and small repetitive increments are the focus. A lot of customer feedback can be received and implemented and this pathway allows for higher flexibility and testing.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer creates new code which will be the mainframe of apps,websites and other softwares.They can also maintain the code running many software and application.They also collaborate with other colleagues when creating new code and maintaining it.

A Quality Assurance Engineer primarily ensure the quality of the code running the software. They are responsible for having a clear and consice requirement of the code from the stake holder, they set-up standards and procedures to be followed and verify the quality of the code before it is deployed.

A project manager is the lead of a software development team and is responsible for assembling the team. He/she is responsible for tracking and communication of key milestones. They development the project plan for the project. They also discuss the requirements with the client and software developers and they deliver the final product to the client and checks it's progress regularly. 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE's are paltforms where code can be written such as VS Code. They are primarily used to write,edit and compile code. They also have intelligent asistive features that enable coding to be made easier and simpler. There is preditive writing which can suggest prompts to help write the code. Some sections can be formated using colors, italics and bold to easily read and discover sintax errors. They can increase productivity by performing repeatable development tasks that are typically part of every code change.

Version control systems are applications which can manage and track change made to code or the differenet version of code that exists. They allow for easy collaboration, error and change tracking. An example of a vsc if git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Software engineers face rapidly evolving technologies in their industreies and one way to combat this issue is adopting continious learning. Always learning and researching about newer technologies and keeping their skills sharp. Another issue is software security, one needs to research how to combat phising, malware among other threats when creating software. Another issue is  software accesibility and usability. Software engineers need to create scalable and realible software which will be easier and less complex for the end user. Changing of software requirements is another issue faced by software engineers. To combat this agile developmenta pathways must be implemented.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
A unit test tests the individual units of code ensuring that every unit is running correctly. Intergration tests tests that the various modules or services worked well together as intended. System tests test the entire system ensuring the system functions properly as a whole. An acceptance test test to see if the system satisfies the business requirements, the system needs to be on for the test to occur and varify the system by replicating user inputs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of developing desired AI Outputs by guiding it's interpretation of Inputs. Prompt engineering allows for a better user experience, flexibility and allows the developer to control how the AI functions.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Create an illustration depicting culture. 

Create an illustration depicting the various cultures and tribes from South Africa. Include their traditional clothing,colors, huts and their way of life. Include the landscape of South Africa whilst showing the respective location of the tribes.
