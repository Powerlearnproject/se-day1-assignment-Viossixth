Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a branch of computer science that involves the development of code, maintainance of it, testing and further optimising. It is important in the technology industry because it is the basic building blocks of most applications, websites or software that we use. Any software that we use on a daily basis has been developed from the principles and knowledge of software engineering.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Mastering Complexity
Mastering Process
Mastering Machine


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning 
Requirement Analysis
Design
Coding
Testing


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of developing desired AI Outputs by guiding it's interpretation of Inputs. Prompt engineering allows for a better user experience, flexibility and allows the developer to control how the AI functions.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Create an illustration depicting culture. 

Create an illustration depicting the various cultures and tribes from South Africa. Include their traditional clothing,colors, huts and their way of life. Include the landscape of South Africa whilst showing the respective location of the tribes.
